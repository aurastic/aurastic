# Hi, I’m Alex!
- I’m interested in developing games and apps and meeting new people.
- I’m currently learning python and javascript (and how to use git).
- I’m looking to collaborate on games and apps.

- I would say my C# skills are at an intermediate level. You can check out my code for Space Bud in my space-bud repository. 
- I have a bachelor's degree in biotechnology and I'm working on a second degree in interdisciplinary arts & performance.
- I love learning music and making things.

- I also like knitting, crochet, and jigsaw puzzles. 
- I have many project ideas that I want to make a reality!
